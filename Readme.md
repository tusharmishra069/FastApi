# FastAPI Overview

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use while providing powerful features for developers.

---

## Key Features

- Fast: Built on [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/), making it one of the fastest Python frameworks.
- Easy to Use: Minimal boilerplate, great for beginners.
- Automatic Documentation: Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.
- Type Safety: Leverages Python type hints for validation and serialization.
- Asynchronous Support: Native support for `async` and `await`.

---

## Use Cases

FastAPI is highly versatile and can be applied across a variety of domains:

### 1. Web Development

- Build RESTful APIs for web applications.
- Create backend services for Single Page Applications (SPAs) or Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
- Serve dynamic content using templating engines like Jinja2.

### 2. AI / ML Applications

- Serve machine learning models as APIs for inference.
- Integrate with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.
- Build real-time AI-powered applications such as chatbots or recommendation systems.

### 3. Internet of Things (IoT)

- Develop APIs to manage IoT devices and collect sensor data.
- Build real-time dashboards for monitoring IoT systems.

### 4. Data Engineering

- Create APIs for data ingestion and processing pipelines.
- Serve data from databases or data lakes to frontend applications.

### 5. Microservices

- Build lightweight, high-performance microservices for distributed systems.
- Integrate with message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven architectures.

### 6. Healthcare

- Develop APIs for managing patient records and healthcare data.
- Build secure and compliant systems for telemedicine and health monitoring.

### 7. E-commerce

- Create APIs for managing products, orders, and user accounts.
- Build scalable backend systems for online stores.

# TusharNotes - A Simple Note-Taking App

Welcome to **TusharNotes**, a beginner-friendly note-taking application built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**. This guide will help you set up, run, and understand the project.

## Features
- Add notes with a title, description, and importance flag.
- View all your notes on a simple web interface.
- Backend powered by FastAPI and data stored in MongoDB.
- Responsive UI styled with Bootstrap.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+
- Pip (Python package manager)
- MongoDB Atlas (or a local MongoDB instance)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tusharmishra069/FastApi.git
cd FastApi
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure MongoDB
- Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster or use a local MongoDB instance.
- Update the `MONGO_URI` in `db.py` with your MongoDB connection string.

### 5. Run the Application
Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
```bash
uvicorn index:app --reload
```
The app will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

### 6. Access the Web Interface
- Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
- Use the form to add notes and view them on the same page.

## Project Structure
```
TusharNotes/
├── index.py               # Main entry point for the FastAPI app
├── db.py                  # MongoDB connection setup
├── routes/
│   └── note.py            # Routes for handling notes
├── templates/
│   └── index.html         # HTML template for the web interface
└── static/                # Static files (CSS, JS, etc.)
```

## How It Works

### Backend
- Built with **FastAPI**.
- Key routes:
    - `GET /`: Fetch and display all notes.
    - `POST /add_note`: Add a new note using JSON payload.
    - `POST /create_item`: Add a new note using form data.

### Frontend
- Simple HTML page styled with **Bootstrap**.
- Users can add notes via a form and view them below.

### Database
- Notes are stored in a **MongoDB** database.
- The `db.py` file handles the connection to MongoDB.
